# Firebase Asynchronous Operation Error: Accessing Document Snapshot Before Data is Loaded

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase when dealing with asynchronous operations and accessing data from document snapshots before the data has fully loaded.  The example shows the problematic code and provides a corrected version using async/await for improved error handling and code clarity.

## Problem

The issue occurs when attempting to access properties of a document snapshot before the asynchronous `getDoc()` or `onSnapshot()` method has completed.  This typically results in an error because the `data()` property will be undefined or null until the data is fetched from the server.

## Solution

The solution employs the async/await pattern or promise chaining to ensure that the code waits for the data to be loaded before accessing it. This approach enhances the code's reliability and makes asynchronous operations more manageable.

## Usage

1.  Clone the repository
2.  Install Firebase (`npm install firebase`) 
3.  Configure your Firebase project.
4.  Run the JavaScript files to observe the behavior of the problematic and corrected code.
